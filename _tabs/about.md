## My Story

I am a software engineer with a primary focus on embedded development. I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Busan National University.

My technical expertise includes the precise analysis of signals from various sensors, developing algorithms, and implementing functionalities to transmit values to the UI via wireless communication. I excel in creating robust solutions that ensure seamless data transmission and accurate sensor data interpretation.

I have extensive experience in both embedded and application development, and I am proficient in working with both Windows and Linux environments. Additionally, I am skilled in statistical analysis and am always eager to acquire new technologies without hesitation.

In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies and staying active with various forms of exercise. I am proactive and optimistic, always looking for ways to improve myself and embrace new challenges.

Previously, I was a Taekwondo athlete, but I had to stop due to a major injury, specifically a cruciate ligament rupture. To enhance my language skills, I studied English in the UK and the Philippines for a total of a year.
